                            <div id="">
                                <p>Prince Obinna Lawrence Nwosu was born on the 13th December 1990 to the family of His Royal Majesty Eze Sir Uzo Nwosu JP and Ugoeze Professor Ngozi Nwosu JP (Umukabia Autonomous community, Abia state).

He proceeded to England for his MSc in Investment and Finance. On returning to Nigeria 2015, he had a stint in the private sector before deciding that his future was in public service. </p>
                                <p>In 2017, he started working with the Federal Ministry of Labour and Employment and was deployed to Abia state. His experience working in Abia made him realize that there is so much that has been left undone from a broad perspective. This activated a divine burden in his heart to run for Governor of Abia to champion the resuscitation of a new Abia state, and reposition the state to its beautiful trajectory during the days of Micheal Okpara. After 3 years working in Abia state, He was recently deployed to Abuja where he is currently adding his own quota to nation building.

He is, therefore making consultations and preparing to run for Governor of Abia state 2023. According to him, Abia has so much God-given potential which is under-utilized. He considers himself as the guy for the job, and that the people of Abia state would be making a sound decision by voting him in as governor in 2023. He wants to bring our best minds together, young and old, men and women so that Abians can collectively resuscitate God's own state.</p>
